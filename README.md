beer-finderWeb
==============

Beer finder keeps track of beers you like and recommends new ones for you to try based on your preferences, the preferences of users who share your tastes, and your location.  We hope you'll support your local brewers, so we highlight things made near you.  (Don't worry - we won't use your location without asking.)

Stack: Node.js and Express server, Neo4j graph database, and Angular.js.  Mobile version of the app built in Swift and Objective C.

Features:

The first time you log in, we'll ask you to rate some beers to get a baseline idea of your preferences.  From there, how you use the app is up to you!

Visit your homepage, where you can see all the beers you've rated.  Check out your recommendations page, containing a list that we tailor to you and your location, and update as you add more ratings.  On vacation?  If you say it's ok for us to use your location, we'll update it when you're someplace new.  Have a few extra hours on vacation or a business trip?  Why not check out a local brewery?

You can also search for beers based on beer name or keyword, and filter those search results however you like.  If you want to get more detail about a beer, just click on its icon.  Find a beer you like?  Use the "show me similar beers" feature - we'll sort your results so that it's easy to find similar beers that are also local beers (but you can search through those results however you want).  Wherever you are in the site, you'll be able to rate the beers you're looking at - and the more you rate, the more accurate our recommendations will get.

Ideas for the future:

-Let users search for and friend/follow other users to share recommendations.
-Let users write reviews of beer, and add those reviews to the algorithm that finds similar beers.
-Develop an API that would let people suggest new data to add. 
-Add typeahead to the search box.
